# ChangeKeyboardText Chrome Extension

## Overview
This Chrome extension allows users to input text in either English or Hebrew. The extension automatically detects the input language (using ASCII or Unicode detection) and displays the text converted to the other language in a separate textbox. This is useful for users who accidentally type in the wrong keyboard layout or want to quickly switch between English and Hebrew text representations.
